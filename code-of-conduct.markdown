## SAFETY AND ACCESS

Our goals to create an inclusive and welcoming event where all people can enjoy social dancing and Blues music in a safe and comfortable environment. We welcome dancers of all experience levels, and all people regardless of race, religion, nationality, physical ability, mental ability, gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance, or age. We expect all attendees to treat everyone with respect regardless of the factors mentioned above. To this end, everyone must read this document and abide by its principles. This document is not all-inclusive, but should be treated as a guide to our values.

## CODE OF CONDUCT

1. Be respectful of each other and the other dancers
   1. Romantic Advances - Do not interpret dance connection as attraction. It is not appropriate to ask your partner out while dancing
   2. Aerials, Dips, & Tricks - Aerials are not allowed on our social dance floors. Dips and tricks should only be done between practiced and consenting partners
   3. Public Displays of Affection - Please refrain from overtly sexualized activities on the dance floor (e.g. grinding, making out, roaming hands). Dancing can be close; this does not mean it is sexual
   4. Community Wellness - If at any time you find yourself impaired – by alcohol, exhaustion, distress etc. – in a way that makes it difficult or impossible for you to follow this Code of Conduct, please take time to rest, eat, recover etc. until you can do so. If you need support, please reach out to any Bitchin' Blues Organizer or member of the Safety Team. Please check in with anyone who appears to be struggling!
   5. Consensual Connections - Please be considerate of the needs of your partner in terms of closeness, energy level, and connection type. Do not use pressure or force to bring your partner into connection.
   6. In General - Deliberate boundary pushing will not be tolerated.

2. It's always ok to say no to any dance, hold, move, or partner that makes you feel uncomfortable
   1. Right to Refusal - Everyone has the right to decline or leave a dance, with or without explanation. Do not take it personally if someone says no to a dance with you, if they dance with someone else during that song, or if they leave a dance mid-song. Keep in mind that there are many possible reasons for someone not dancing with you, and respect that nobody owes anybody else a dance
   2. Unsolicited Feedback - Do NOT critique, criticize, or teach on the dance floor unless specifically asked
   3. Self-Advocacy - Speak up if you are uncomfortable, in pain, or at risk of being hurt

3. Communicate abundantly, with your partner and/or a party organizer if there's an issue or if you have any questions
   1. Non-verbal Communication - If you notice non-verbal signals like body stiffening, hesitation, etc., and/or are unsure about what connection is appropriate for your partner, ask. Dance is a conversation — listen to each other!
   2. Dancefloor Consent - Do not do weight bearing moves, such as deep dips, without verbal consent.
   3. Escalation - If you have a question, comment, complaint or concern, please bring it to any Bitchin' Blues Organizer or member of the Safety Team, either by approaching them directly or by using our event reporting form, either via QR codes or the reporting e-mail address. Verbal or written complaints brought to us will be taken seriously and handled with care and confidentiality, and people who do not follow these policies after an intervention may be asked to leave the event
   4. Safety Concerns - If you are hurt or made to feel unsafe or uncomfortable in any way by a fellow attendee, please immediately bring this to the attention of any Bitchin' Blues Organizer or Safety Team member
   5. Consistent Respect - Everyone attending any Bitchin' Blues event is expected to respect the boundaries of others on and off the dance floor, even outside the scheduled events and venues
   6. Receiving Feedback - If someone tells you that something you are doing is hurting anyone, or making anyone feel unsafe or uncomfortable, immediately stop the behavior. We understand that it can be challenging not to take this feedback personally, and we hope that you can see this as a learning opportunity. If you are not sure how to change the behavior, please ask an Organizer or member of the Safety Team for support
   7. Community Advocacy and Reporting - Even if you are not directly involved, if you notice someone is hurting a fellow attendee or causing them to feel unsafe or uncomfortable we still ask that you bring this to the attention of a Bitchin' Blues Organizer or Safety Team member. You are part of the Safety Team with us, and we are all responsible for creating an inclusive and welcoming event. We would rather you speak up unnecessarily than left a problem to develop
   8. Accessibility - If there is an issue with the space or event that is impeding your full participation e.g. an allergen issue or other access issue, please let us know. We will do our best to resolve the situation as fast as possible given our resources

4. Have fun!

## ISSUE ESCALATION PROCESS

When you bring an issue to a member of the DFW BluesDance Network Code of Conduct Council Safety Team, you can expect:

* An initial conversation away from other attendees
* Confidentiality (unless we feel someone is in immediate danger)
* To be asked how you would like the situation to be handled
* The situation to be shared with additional committee members
* The next steps to be determined in consultation with you

Some next steps may include the reported person being:

* Observed, but not approached, to keep an eye on them for further issues
* Spoken to directly about their behavior and asked to stop
* Removed from the event, and/or banned from future events
* Reported to venue organizer or safety team and/or police

We reserve the right to ban individuals from attending any house parties or private events operated under the Bitchin' Blues Code of Conduct. While we will attempt to follow a restorative approach wherever possible, anyone who does or says something inappropriate, disrespectful, overtly sexual, illegal, dangerous, or otherwise violates any of the policies set forth here will face consequences, which may include immediate removal from the event, banning from future events, and legal action.

If an attendee is:

* A convicted sexual offender
* Currently being tried for a sexual offense
* Has a Protection from Abuse (PFA) against them
* Has a restraining order against them

This person may be banned, refused entrance, and/or removed from the event. Please notify any Bitchin' Blues Organizer or Safety Team member if you know of any such individual who may plan to attend the event, or if this describes you.

Any form of harassment or harm that is persistent, severe, or that continues after feedback, will be responded to as a major safety and access concern, whether or not it occurs at the event itself.

This policy was adapted from a policy written by Steel City Blues in consultation with Jaesic Wade and Fen Lastra (Kennedy) of Changeling Spaces and adopted by the Bitchin' Blues Organizer for Dallas Blues Dance Network
