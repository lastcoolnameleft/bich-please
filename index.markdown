Created by Black Americans alongside blues music, "blues dance" is a contemporary umbrella term for a range of partnered and solo styles.  It is rhythmic, improvisational & soulful.  

Weâ€™ve come together to bond over our love of Blues. That said:

1. **B**e respectful of each other and the other dancers
2. **I**t's always ok to say no to any dance, hold, move, or partner that makes you feel uncomfortable
3. **C**ommunicate abundantly, with your partner and/or a party organizer if there's an issue or if you have any questions 
4. **H**ave fun!

Said aloud, BICH PLEASE!

Please see our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct) for additional details
