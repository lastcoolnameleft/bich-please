Blues is a social dance, and our mission is to dance with people! Weâ€™ve come together to bond over our love of Blues. That said:

1. *B*e respectful of each other and the other dancers
2. *I*t's always ok to say no to any dance, hold, move, or partner that makes you feel uncomfortable
3. *C*ommunicate abundantly, with your partner and/or a party organizer if there's an issue or if you have any questions 
4. *H*ave fun!

Said aloud, BICH PLEASE!
